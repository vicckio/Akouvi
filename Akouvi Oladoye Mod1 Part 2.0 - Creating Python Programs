# Part 2: Program to calculate multiplication and division of 2 numbers

# Ask user for input
(Python starts running from top)
num1 = float(input("Enter first number:"))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number:"))

# Multiply both numbers enetered by user
Multiplication = num1 * num2

# Display results of multiplacation
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)

# Perform division and check for zero
if num2 !=0:
    division = num1 /num2
